- Training a Neural Language Model
- t-SNE implementation, which gives a 2 dimensional plot of the distributed representation space

Assignment 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks

- Image colorization as a classification problem
- Exploring different convolution mechanisms
- Image segmentation as a classification problem
- Fine-tuning image segmentation models

Assignment 3 - Attention Based Neural Machine Translation

- Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) implementation (RNN encoder + decoder)
- Implementation of RNN encoder + decoder with additive attention
- Training Transformer encoder + decoder with scaled dot product attention
- Fine Tuning Transformers such as Bert and GPT for arithemetic sentiment analysis

Assignment 4 - DCGAN, StyleGAN, and DQN

- Implementing Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
- Experimenting with StyleGAN2-Ada
- Experiment with Deep Q-Learning Network to tackle the CartPole Balancing Game from OpenAI Gym
